# ParaGopher

![ParaGopher](./screenshot.png)

**ParaGopher** is a retro-style arcade game written in Go using [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org). 
Inspired by the classic [Paratrooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratrooper_(video_game)) IBM PC game (1982),
the game allows the player to control a turret that must defend the base against incoming paratroopers. Tilt the turret,
shoot down threats, and prevent paratroopers from reaching your base!

## Running the game
Ensure you have Go installed. You can download it from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/). 
```
git clone https://github.com/ystepanoff/ParaGopher
cd ParaGopher
go run cmd/game.go
```

Alternatively, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/ystepanoff/ParaGopher/releases) section, which contains pre-built binaries
for some platforms.

## Controls
* Left Arrow (`←`): Rotate turret barrel to the left.
* Right Arrow (`→`): Rotate turret barrel to the right.
